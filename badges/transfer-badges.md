Here you can write a list of addresses in the text input, writing one address at line, without any kind of comma or other separator. This is an example:

```
0xE6c30AD5AeE7AD22e9F39D51d67667587cdD05A1
0x19ddC76B6ea171e6C89E586907504753f040127b
0xaF8106c0F119df2f5D923432DD71A8d264EBE3e7
0x3fAeaf31d8105291fdA7637B941848C6647a6Bc9
```

After you created your list simply write on "SEND BADGES", you will need to confirm each transfer with your Metamask account.
