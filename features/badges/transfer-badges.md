# Transfer badges

To transfer badges just click on the _transfer_ icon, you will be redirected to this page

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/transfer without address (1).png>)

Here you can write a list of addresses in the text input, writing one address at line, without any kind of comma or other separator. This is an example:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer.png)

After you created your list simply write on "SEND BADGES", you will need to confirm each transfer with your Metamask account.
