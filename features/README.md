# Features

**MEGO Names** allows you to mint your own name, associate it with your wallet, and generate a customized card (NFT) to be seen on OpenSea as regular ERC-721 tokens. These are stored directly in the blockchain and are rendered as SVG, you will then be able to change the colours and add your logo. That's not all: you can also hook up specific PFP collections and link your NFT to the profile!

**MEGO Badges** grants you the opportunity to mine and deliver ERC-1155 tokens in order to notarize achievements, participation in online/offline events and so on. This feature is a "POAP"-like and is free, you will be charged only for the minting costs.

**MEGO PGP** is designed to streamline transaction management, providing an extra level of security.

**MEGO Tickets** provides you with a system for the sale and emission of NFT tickets for your events. Thanks to a simple integration, they can also be sold in FIAT.

The next stage of MEGO will be the release of a **Decentralized CMS**, thanks to which you will be able to store your content directly within the blockchain, in an immutable and secure form. You will no longer need a centralized database, thus lowering management costs, increasing security and reducing environmental impact.
